title: "An Active Learning Algorithm Based on Parzen Window Classiï¬\x81cation"
abstract: This paper describes active learning algorithm used in AISTATS 2010 Active
  Learning Challenge as well as several of its extensions evaluated in the post-competition
  experiments. The algorithm consists of a pair of Regularized Parzen Window Classifiers,
  one trained on full set of features and another on features filtered using Pearson
  correlation. Predictions of the two classifiers are averaged to obtain the ensemble
  classifier. Parzen Window classifier was chosen because is an easy to implement
  lazy algorithm and has a single parameter, the kernel window size, that is determined
  by the cross-validation. The labeling schedule started by selecting random 20 examples
  and then continued by doubling the number of labeled examples in each round of active
  learning. A combination of random sampling and uncertainty sampling was used for
  querying. For the random sampling, examples were first clustered using either all
  features or the filtered features (whichever resulted in higher cross-validated
  accuracy) and then the same number of random examples was selected from each cluster.
  Our algorithm ranked as the 5th overall, and was consistently ranked in the upper
  half of the competing algorithms. The challenge results show that Parzen Window
  classifiers are less accurate than several competing learning algorithms used in
  the competition, but also indicate the success of the simple querying strategy that
  was employed. In the post-competition, we were able to improve the accuracy by using
  an ensemble of 5 Parzen Window classifiers, each trained on features selected by
  different filters. We also explored how more involved querying during the initial
  stages of active learning and the pre-clustering querying strategy would influence
  the performance of the proposed algorithm.
