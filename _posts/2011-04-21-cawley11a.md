title: Baseline Methods for Active Learning
abstract: In many potential applications of machine learning, unlabelled data are
  abundantly available at low cost, but there is a paucity of labelled data, and labeling
  unlabelled examples is expensive and/or time-consuming. This motivates the development
  of active learning methods, that seek to direct the collection of labelled examples
  such that the greatest performance gains can be achieved using the smallest quantity
  of labelled data. In this paper, we describe some simple pool-based active learning
  strategies, based on optimally regularised linear [kernel] ridge regression, providing
  a set of baseline submissions for the Active Learning Challenge. A simple random
  strategy, where unlabelled patterns are submitted to the oracle purely at random,
  is found to be surprisingly effective, being competitive with more complex approaches.
