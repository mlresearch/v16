title: 'From Theories to Queries: Active Learning in Practice'
abstract: This article surveys recent work in active learning aimed at making it more
  practical for real-world use. In general, active learning systems aim to make machine
  learning more economical, since they can participate in the acquisition of their
  own training data. An active learner might iteratively select informative query
  instances to be labeled by an oracle, for example. Work over the last two decades
  has shown that such approaches are effective at maintaining accuracy while reducing
  training set size in many machine learning applications. However, as we begin to
  deploy active learning in real ongoing learning systems and data annotation projects,
  we are encountering unexpected problems--due in part to practical realities that
  violate the basic assumptions of earlier foundational work. I review some of these
  issues, and discuss recent work being done to address the challenges.
