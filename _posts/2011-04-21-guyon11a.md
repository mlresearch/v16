title: Results of the Active Learning Challenge
abstract: We organized a machine learning challenge on ``active learning'', addressing
  problems where labeling data is expensive, but large amounts of unlabeled data are
  available at low cost. Examples include handwriting and speech recognition, document
  classification, vision tasks, drug design using recombinant molecules and protein
  engineering. The algorithms may place a limited number of queries to get new sample
  labels. The design of the challenge and its results are summarized in this paper
  and the best contributions made by the participants are included in these proceedings.
  The website of the challenge remains open as a resource for students and researchers
  (http://clopinet.com/al).
