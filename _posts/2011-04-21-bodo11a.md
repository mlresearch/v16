title: Active Learning with Clustering
abstract: Active learning is an important field of machine learning and it is becoming
  more widely used in case of problems where labeling the examples in the training
  data set is expensive. In this paper we present a clustering-based algorithm used
  in the Active Learning Challenge (http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/activelearning.php).
  The algorithm is based on graph clustering with normalized cuts, and uses k-means
  to extract representative points from the data and approximate spectral clustering
  for efficiently performing the computations.
