title: Active Learning and Experimental Design with SVMs
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider active learning as a procedure of iteratively
  performing two steps: first, we train a classifier based on labeled and unlabeled
  data. Second, we query labels of some data points. The first part is achieved mainly
  by standard classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression. We develop additional
  techniques when there are very few labeled data. These techniques help to obtain
  good classifiers in the early stage of the active learning procedure. In the second
  part, based on SVM or logistic regression decision values, we propose a framework
  to flexibly select points for query. We find that selecting points with various
  distances to the decision boundary is important, but including more points close
  to the decision boundary further improves the performance. Our experiments are conducted
  on the data sets of Causality Active Learning Challenge. With measurements of Area
  Under Curve (AUC) and Area under the Learning Curve (ALC), we find suitable methods
  for different data sets.'
