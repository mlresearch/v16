title: Inspecting Sample Reusability for Active Learning
abstract: Active Learning (AL) exploits a learning algorithm to selectively sample
  examples which are expected to be highly useful for model learning. The resulting
  sample is governed by a sampling selection bias. While a bias towards useful examples
  is desirable, there is also a bias towards the learner applied during AL selection.
  This paper addresses sample reusability, i.e., the question whether and under which
  conditions samples selected by AL using one learning algorithm are well-suited as
  training data for another learning algorithm.    Our empirical investigation on
  general classification problems as well as the natural language processing subtask
  of Named Entity Recognition shows that many intuitive assumptions on reusability
  characteristics do not hold. For example, using the same algorithm during AL selection
  (called selector) and for inducing the final model (called consumer) is not always
  the optimal choice. We investigate several putatively explanatory factors for sample
  reusability. One finding is that the suitability of certain selector-consumer pairings
  cannot be estimated independently of the actual learning problem.
