title: Active Batch Learning with Stochastic Query-by-Forest (SQBF)
abstract: In a conventional machine learning approach, one uses labeled data to train
  the model. However, often we have a data set with few labeled instances, and a large
  number of unlabeled ones. This is called a semi-supervised learning problem. It
  is well known that often unlabeled data could be used to improve a model. In real
  world scenarios, labeled data can usually be obtained dynamically. However, obtaining
  new labels in most cases requires human effort and/or is costly. An active learning
  (AL) paradigm tries to direct the queries in such way that a good model can be trained
  with a relatively small number of queries. In this work we focus on so-called pool-based
  active learning, i.e., learning when there is a fixed large pool of unlabeled data,
  and we can query the label for any instance from this pool at some cost. Existing
  methods are often based on strong assumptions for the joint input/output distribution
  (i.e., a mixture of Gaussians, linearly separable input space, etc.), or use a distance-based
  approach (such as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distances). That makes such methods very
  susceptible to noise in input space, and they often work poorly in high dimensions.
  Also, such methods assume numeric inputs only. In addition, for most methods relying
  on distance computations and/or linear models, computational complexity scales at
  least quadratically with respect to the number of unlabeled samples, rendering them
  useless on large datasets. In real world applications data is often large, noisy,
  contains irrelevant inputs, missing values, and mixed variable types. Often queries
  should be arranged in groups or batches (this is called batch AL). In batch querying
  one should consider both the ’usefulness’ of individual queries within a batch,
  and the batch diversity. Batch AL, although being very practical by nature, is rarely
  addressed by existing AL approaches. Here we propose a new non-parametric approach
  to the AL problem called Stochastic Query by Forest (SQRF), that effectively addresses
  the challenges described above. Our algorithm is based on a QBC algorithm applied
  to an RF ensemble, and our main contribution is the batch diversification strategy.
  We describe two different strategies for batch selection, the first of which achieved
  the highest average score on the AISTATS 2010 active learning challenge and ranked
  top on one of the challenge datasets. Our work focuses on binary classification
  problems, but our method can be directly applied to regression or multi-class problems
  with minor modifications.
