title: Autonomous Experimentation:Active Learning for Enzyme Response Characterisation
abstract: Characterising response behaviours of biological systems is impaired by
  limited resources that restrict the exploration of high dimensional parameter spaces.
  Additionally, experimental errors that provide observations not representative of
  the true underlying behaviour, mean that observations obtained from these experiments
  cannot be regarded as always valid. To combat the problem of erroneous observations
  in situations where there are limited observations available to learn from, we consider
  the use of multiple hypotheses, where potentially erroneous observations are considered
  as being erroneous and valid in parallel by competing hypotheses. Here we describe
  work towards an autonomous experimentation machine that combines active learning
  techniques with computer controlled experimentation platforms to perform physical
  experiments. Whilst the target for our approach is the characterisation of the behaviours
  of networks of enzymes for novel computing mechanisms, the algorithms we are working
  towards remain independent of the application domain.
