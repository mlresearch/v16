title: Active Learning for Unbalanced Data in the Challenge with Multiple Models and
  Biasing
abstract: The common uncertain sampling approach searches for the most uncertain samples
  closest to the decision boundary for a classification task. However, we might fail
  to find the uncertain samples when we have a poor probabilistic model. In this work,
  we develop an active learning strategy called ``Uncertainty Sampling with Biasing
  Consensus'' (USBC) which predicts the unbalanced data by multi-model committee and
  ranks the informativeness of samples by uncertainty sampling with higher weight
  on the minority class. For prediction, we use Random Forests based multiple models
  that generate the consensus posterior probability for each sample as part of USBC.
  To further improve the initial performance in active learning, we also use a semi-supervised
  learning model that self labels predicted negative samples without querying. For
  more stable initial performance, we use a filter to avoid querying samples with
  high variance. We also introduce batch size validation to find the optimal initial
  batch size for querying samples in active learning.
