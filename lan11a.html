<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   <h3>Abstract</h3> This paper describes active learning algorithm used in AISTATS 2010 Active
Learning Challenge as well as several of its extensions evaluated in the post-competition
experiments. The algorithm consists of a pair of Regularized Parzen Window Classiﬁers, one
trained on full set of features and another on features ﬁltered using Pearson correlation.
Predictions of the two classiﬁers are averaged to obtain the ensemble classiﬁer. Parzen Window
classiﬁer was chosen because is an easy to implement lazy algorithm and has a single parameter,
the kernel window size, that is determined by the cross-validation. The labeling schedule started
by selecting random 20 examples and then continued by doubling the number of labeled examples
in each round of active learning. A combination of random sampling and uncertainty sampling
was used for querying. For the random sampling, examples were ﬁrst clustered using either all
features or the ﬁltered features (whichever resulted in higher cross-validated accuracy)
and then the same number of random examples was selected from each cluster. Our
algorithm ranked as the 5th overall, and was consistently ranked in the upper half of the
competing algorithms. The challenge results show that Parzen Window classiﬁers are
less accurate than several competing learning algorithms used in the competition, but
also indicate the success of the simple querying strategy that was employed. In the
post-competition, we were able to improve the accuracy by using an ensemble of 5
Parzen Window classiﬁers, each trained on features selected by diﬀerent ﬁlters. We also
explored how more involved querying during the initial stages of active learning and
the pre-clustering querying strategy would inﬂuence the performance of the proposed
algorithm.
